# HandPilot

A gesture-based control system that uses hand movements to interact with a computer interface. Control the mouse cursor, click, double-click, scroll, and drag using hand gestures captured via webcam.

## Features

- **Cursor Control**: Use your index finger or thumb to move the cursor.
- **Double-Click**: Hold your thumb and index finger together for 2 seconds to trigger a double-click.
- **Drag-and-Drop**: Initiate a drag by holding the thumb and index finger together for 2 seconds. Keep them together to drag and separate to release.
- **Scroll**: Use a fist gesture with one hand and move it up or down to scroll.
- **Smoothing**: Built-in cursor position smoothing to reduce jittery movements.
